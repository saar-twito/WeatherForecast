Weather app for every city in the world + 5 days forecasts.
In this app, I use 4 Accuweather APIs:
a) Autocomplete search - Returns matching an autocomplete of the search text.
b) Current Conditions -  Returns current conditions data for a specific location.
c) 5 Days of Daily Forecasts - Returns an array of daily forecasts for the next 5 days for a specific location.
d) Geoposition Search - Returns information about a specific location by GeoPosition (user location).

I used Typescript.
I used react hooks.
I used ReduxToolkit to manage the state of the app.
I used debounce to prevent HTTP requests on each keypress.

The website design is fully responsive.
